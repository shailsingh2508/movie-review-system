 ## Code Summary
 
 This application is a Ruby command-line application designed to generate movie reviews as tweets. Following the MVC architecture, the application ensures clear separation of concerns, making the codebase modular and maintainable. Key components include models representing movie reviews and movies, controllers responsible for parsing JSON data and composing tweets, and a view for terminal output formatting.

 The adoption of the Model-View-Controller (MVC) architecture was a pivotal decision in crafting this application. By compartmentalizing the application into distinct models, views, and controllers, it becomes easier to understand and modify different aspects of the system without impacting other parts.
